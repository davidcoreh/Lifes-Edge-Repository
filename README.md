<!-- Future Updates-->
# Potential Future Updates
## Gallery Section:
- A gallery section would be an excellent update to make to the site in future to add more positive user experience to the site, as past client images will attract new clients to the company and its services, while also making the site even more appealing to the user visually.

## Review section:
- A review section would make an excellent future update to the site, as past client reviews are likely to convince new and existing clients of not only the benefits of using Life's Edge services but also peace of mind in booking services knowing many past clients have a positive experience to share with others.

## Video Testimonials:
- In addition to a review section, a section for video testimonials from clients as they carry out the activities of their choice will be a positive future update to the website, as this will promote attaining new clients and gives new and existing clients a real look at what Life's Edge are offering.

<!-- Debugging -->
# Debugging
## Debugging with DevTools 
- Chrome DevTools were used in the debugging process to find and fix unusual behaviour, and while implementing responsive design for different device widths.

## Debugging with W3C Validation
- Attempts at validating html and css code uncovered any substandard code to be fixed to pass validation.

<!-- Bugs and Fixes -->
# Bugs and Fixes
## Break Points
- After extensive testing in Chrome DevTools, unusual break points in the reponsivness of some elements were discovered.
- Using media queries these break points were fixed by targeting the width of the device screen at the time the elements break.

## Broken Nav Link
- After initial testing it was clear the contact nav link only worked on index.html but not from other html files.
- Checking href attributes showed a slash in the file path was causing an error. The file path was edited and contact nav links now work across all files.
